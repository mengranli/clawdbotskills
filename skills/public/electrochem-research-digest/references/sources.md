# Sources & coverage

## Journals / publishers (preferred)

Primary targets (use RSS or publisher listing pages when available):
- Nature (and family): Nature, Nature Energy, Nature Chemistry, Nature Materials, Nature Sustainability, Nature Communications, Nature Chemical Engineering
- Science, Science Advances
- ACS Energy Letters
- Energy & Environmental Science
- Advanced Materials

Notes:
- Many are partially paywalled; aim to collect at least: title, authors, date, journal, URL.
- Abstract availability depends on publisher; when unavailable, extract the publicly visible abstract snippet or skip the abstract and note "abstract not available".

## Research groups (people)

Track new papers/posts mentioning:
- Ted Sargent
- David Sinton
- Peter Strasser
- Tom Burdyny
- Brian Seger
- Haotian Wang
- Shannon Boettcher

Heuristics: search for (author:"<name>") via Crossref/Semantic Scholar/arXiv; also keyword search that includes the group name.

## Topics (keywords)

- CO2 electrolysis / CO2 reduction / CO2R
- AEM water electrolysis
- H2 separation / electrochemical compression
- carbon capture and conversion
- electrochemical pH swing
- renewable energy investments/funding

## News / social

Desired sources: news sites, LinkedIn, Bluesky.

Important limitations:
- LinkedIn content is often not accessible without login and cannot be reliably scraped.
- Bluesky has APIs but coverage depends on accounts/feeds and rate limits.

Fallback approach:
- Use web search (Brave) for "funding", "Series A", "seed", "grant", "DOE", "ARPA-E", "Breakthrough Energy", "electrolysis", etc.
- If specific Bluesky handles or RSS/newsletters are provided, include them.
