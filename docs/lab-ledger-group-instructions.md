# Lab Ledger — Group Chat Instructions

Use this group chat to log lab purchases into the shared Excel spend ledger.

## How to log a purchase
Post a message that contains:
- the word **buy**
- **item name**
- **total amount + currency** (e.g. `93.94 AUD`)
- **project code** (e.g. `Pursuit`)
- **category** (`consumables` / `equipment` / `chemicals & gases`)

**Recommended format**

`buy <item> <amount> <currency> <project> <category>`

## Examples
- `buy KHCO3 x2 93.94 AUD Pursuit chemicals & gases`
- `buy gloves and tissue 132.78 AUD Pursuit consumables`
- `buy tubing 18.50 AUD DE consumables`
- `buy pressure regulator 220 AUD KC8 CO2R equipment`

## Guidelines
- **One message = one line item.** If you bought multiple things, send multiple lines (best), or list them on separate lines.
- **Avoid duplicates.** If you resend the same “buy …” message, it may be treated as a duplicate and won’t be logged again.

## What happens next
- Purchases are logged automatically to the shared Excel ledger.
- Logging may take ~**1 minute**.
- If required info is missing (project/category/amount), it may not log — please repost with the missing fields.

## Categories (use these words)
- `consumables`
- `equipment`
- `chemicals & gases`

## Project codes
Use one of the lab’s standard project codes:
- `DE`, `DE Est`, `KC8 CO2R`, `KC8 pH swing`, `ASG`, `DP`, `LP`, `Startup`, `Pursuit`
